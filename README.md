# multilabel-indo-hatespeech-classification
My first attempt to reduplicate research papers in Natural Language Processing.

I do a multilabel hatespeech classification based on paper "Muhammad Okky Ibrohim and Indra Budi. 2019. Multi-label Hate Speech and Abusive Language Detection in Indonesian Twitter. In ALW3: 3rd Workshop on Abusive Language Online, 46-57." I tried to follow the best method in the paper by using a several library, there will be a slight differences in stemming because I do it with Sastrawi Library. Overall it gaves a similiar result.

The paper can be accessed here : https://aclanthology.org/W19-3506.pdf

The dataset acquired in the link below, I do a little bit cleaning process and can be checked at multi-label-exploration.ipynb

The result of the models can be accesed in the link below. The .sav model can be accesed using a customized vectorizer provided in this repository, if you want to use it make sure to choose the right one(The name structure of the models and vectorizer is the same)
